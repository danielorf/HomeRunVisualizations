This plot of Average Baseball Speed Off Bat vs Home Run Distance is intended to demonstrate how much of an outlier Coors Field is in comparison to all other MLB ballparks. The reason for Coors Field's outlier status is its elevation - at about 5180 ft, it is significantly higher than the next ballfield Chase Field at about 1080ft. At a higher elevation, a ball flying through the air experiences less drag and can travel farther than ball with similar starting velocity at sea level. Only home runs measured at more than 400 ft were chosen for this dataset to reduce influence of varying field dimensions in different ballparks.
